# calcProj
final project for ap computer science - aka me trying to use graphics in java

# V1 - began 3/23, finished 4/23 
took v long bc i don't have any time lol
basically uses scanner to ask user what they want to do, how many numbers they want to operate, and what numbers 
takes all numbers and puts them in an array then calculates it from that array
incredibly simple, and a bit tedious
